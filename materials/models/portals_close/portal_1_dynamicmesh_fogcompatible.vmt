//Used in texture drawing mode to draw the surface of portal 1 (faking the view through it) when there's fog in the level and the player is far enough away that the projection math won't screw up
//this should look EXACTLY like portal_1_dynamicmesh.vmt with the exception of having "$fogcompatible" set to 1
"Portal"
{
	"$fogcompatible" "1" 							//flag that controls if the material is fog compatible. WARNING: Fog compatibility breaks portal drawing when the camera is near a portal polygon.
	"$basetexture" "_rt_Portal1" 						//portal 1's view
	"$alphamasktexture" "models/portals/portal_mask" 	//alpha mask for defining the portal's edges
