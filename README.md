# Aperture: continued

Aperture Continued is an actively supported, up-to-date addon for Garry's mod that adds various items and gameplay mechanics from the Portal franchise into Garry's mod.

Unlike this addon's predecessor "The aperture", which you may find copies of on the steam workshop, this is still in active development, and as such, new features and bug fixes roll out with every new update.

## Notice as of 7/22/2019
I apologize, but i am sad to say that this addon is no longer in active development or maintenence.
It has become too difficult to maintain it alongside other projects that have taken precedence; but I am still greatful for allt he support that I have gotten because of this Addon.

I would like to take a moment to give Special Thanks to Crishnate, the original addon creator, for being an inspiration for me and allowing me so kindly to continue work on his addon for the time that I did.
