**Is your feature request related to a problem? If so, Please describe.**

This idea is just for the recreation of the exploding turrets

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Make the Turrets along with the rocket turret able to be destroyed.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

If you are able to, i think droppers should be able to drop turrets and maybe have it in a way where
you can make the turrets despawn after a certain amount. Idk this is just a maybe.

**Additional context**

Pretty much sumed it up.

Oh yea and if u can make the turrets target the default npcs in half life and maybe make them target
 each other would be cool.
